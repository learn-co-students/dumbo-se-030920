# Introduction to JavaScript

## Overview of the mod
* Learning a second language; gaining another superpower
  * Schedule
  * Week 1 - Becoming a front-end developer
  * Week 2 - Becoming a better front-end developer & understanding JS fundamentals
  * Week 3 - Project week & shiny new JS

  * Three essential pillars of front-end web programming
    - HTML - Hyper TEXT Markup Language (Skeleton/Structure)
    - CSS - Cascading Stylesheets (Aesthetics/Accessibility )
    - JS - Javascript (Interactions/ Muscle)

    * Three essential pillars of JS
      - DOM Manipulation - Manipulating/changing what the user sees on our website
      - Communication with the Server - Request/response that allow us to get/send information
      - Event Listeners - When an event happens, what do we want to do

      When an event happens,
      We will communicate to the server,
      And change what we see on the website.
